# new_patient_register_management_java
 Patient registry management system is a java project. This project helps the doctor to manage 
the patient records. Also helps to maintain the patient health report. Patient management is a set of 
activities that health care practices use to manage and deliver on patients rising exceptions. It’s an 
approach that focuses on the fostering strong patient relationships instead of just treating illnesses. 
This software can integrate appointment history ,patient information, diagnoses, prescriptions, billing 
records and more. It can also help practices and hospitals reduce cost by automating some tasks like 
appointment scheduling , sending remainders and billing. 
To create this patient registration system we use swing components in java. 
 The frame contains patient details such as : 
• Patient name 
• Patient Aadhar number 
• Patient address 
• Patient mobile number 
• Patient blood group 
• Patient age 
The frame consists of two buttons they are 
• Register 
• Close 
 While entering adhar number of the patient , it must be 12 digits if not it gives an error message as 
invalid adhar number. After entering the patient details ,click the register button then ,we get a 
message as successfully registered the details.If the details of the patient as already registered then 
its gives an error message as already registered .All the registered patient details are stored in 
Details.txt file.
